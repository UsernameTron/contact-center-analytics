## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Contact Center Data Model

The repository includes a complete data model covering all aspects of contact center operations:

- **Customer Interactions**: Data across multiple channels (voice, chat, email, self-service)
- **Agent Performance**: Metrics like adherence, occupancy, handle times, and quality scores
- **Queue Operations**: Service levels, wait times, abandonment rates, and contact volume
- **Technology Integration**: API success rates, response times, error rates, and cost savings
- **Business Outcomes**: CSAT, NPS, FCR, and ROI measurements

### 2. Technology Integration Patterns

The repository demonstrates integration patterns for key contact center technologies:

- **NICE CXone**: Authentication, real-time data access, agent state management, and webhook processing
- **Salesforce Service Cloud**: Contact lookup, case management, knowledge integration, and activity tracking
- **IEX WFM**: Scheduling, adherence tracking, and forecast accuracy measurement
- **AI/Automation**: Containment metrics, sentiment analysis, and deflection rate calculations

### 3. Advanced Data Analytics

The included Jupyter notebooks provide in-depth analysis of contact center operations:

- **Operational Metrics**: Channel distribution, volume patterns, wait time analysis
- **Agent Performance**: Productivity trends, quality correlation, performance tiering
- **Technology Impact**: Integration reliability, AI effectiveness, system response times
- **Business ROI**: Cost per contact trends, savings calculations, containment impact

### 4. Interactive Dashboards

The repository includes both the data and code for four interactive dashboards:

- **Operational Dashboard**: Overview of contact center operational metrics
- **Agent Performance Dashboard**: Agent productivity and quality metrics
- **Technology Dashboard**: Technology performance and integration metrics
- **Business Impact Dashboard**: Cost, ROI, and business outcome metrics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Node.js 16+ (for dashboard development)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/contact-center-analytics.git
   cd contact-center-analytics
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Generate the synthetic data:
   ```bash
   python scripts/data_generation/generate_all_data.py
   ```

4. Run the ETL pipeline to process the data:
   ```bash
   python scripts/analysis/etl_pipeline.py
   ```

5. Export the data to JSON for the dashboard:
   ```bash
   python scripts/exportDataToJSON.py
   ```

6. Install dashboard dependencies and start the development server:
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## API Integration Examples

This repository includes working examples of API integrations with common contact center technologies:

### NICE CXone Integration

The `cxone_integration.py` script demonstrates:
- Authentication with the CXone API
- Retrieving agent states and performance metrics
- Getting queue statistics
- Processing webhook events
- Exporting data to CSV

Example usage:
```python
# Create integration instance
cxone = CXoneIntegration()

# Authenticate
cxone.authenticate()

# Get agent states
agent_states = cxone.get_agent_states()

# Get queue statistics
queue_stats = cxone.get_queue_statistics()
```

### Salesforce Service Cloud Integration

The `salesforce_integration.py` script demonstrates:
- Authenticating with Salesforce
- Customer data retrieval
- Case management
- Knowledge article search
- Sync of contact center activities

### IEX WFM Integration

The `iex_integration.py` script demonstrates:
- Schedule adherence tracking
- Forecast accuracy measurement
- Workforce optimization metrics

## Data Generation

The synthetic data generators create realistic contact center data with appropriate distributions and relationships:

- **Interaction Data**: Realistic channel distribution, time-of-day patterns, handle times
- **Agent Metrics**: Performance distributions, adherence patterns, quality scores
- **Queue Metrics**: Service level variations, abandonment rates, hourly patterns
- **Technology Metrics**: Error rates, response times, AI containment metrics

Run the complete data generation process:
```bash
python scripts/data_generation/generate_all_data.py
```

## Visualization Dashboard

The React-based dashboard visualizes the contact center data with interactive charts and metrics:

- **Operational View**: Channel distribution, hourly patterns, wait time analysis
- **Agent Performance**: Performance distribution, quality metrics, team comparisons
- **Technology Impact**: Success rates, response times, AI containment impact
- **Business Impact**: Cost per contact trends, ROI analysis, savings calculations

The dashboard is deployable to Netlify with automated data updates.
