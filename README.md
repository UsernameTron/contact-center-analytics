A comprehensive analytics solution for contact centers, providing performance metrics, visualizations, and actionable insights to optimize agent performance and customer satisfaction.

![Contact Center Dashboard](case_study/team_performance.png)

## 📋 Overview

This project provides a complete analytics framework for contact centers, focusing on:

- **Agent Performance Metrics**: Detailed analysis of individual agent metrics
- **Team Performance Comparison**: Comparative analysis across different teams
- **Trend Analysis**: Time-series data visualization for key performance indicators
- **Actionable Insights**: Strategic recommendations based on data analysis

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Case Study**: Interactive HTML report with professional visualizations
- **Data Generation Tools**: Python scripts for generating test data and simulations
- **JSON Data Structure**: Standardized data structure for consistency across the system
- **Integration Points**: Documentation for integrating with common contact center platforms
- **Implementation Guidance**: Step-by-step implementation planning documents

## 📊 Key Metrics Tracked

The system tracks the following key performance indicators:

- **Adherence Rate**: Percentage of time agents follow their scheduled activities
- **Occupancy Rate**: Percentage of logged-in time spent handling customers
- **Average Handle Time (AHT)**: Average duration of customer interactions
- **After-Call Work (ACW)**: Time spent on post-interaction tasks
- **Quality Score**: Evaluation of agent performance against quality standards
- **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)**: Rating from 1-5 of customer experience
- **First Contact Resolution (FCR)**: Percentage of issues resolved in first interaction
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: Likelihood of customers to recommend service
